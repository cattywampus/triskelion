# Triskelion

This application was intended to be a learning exercise for the Qt framework.
The purpose of the application was to mathematically compute and render a
[triskelion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion) pattern using an
[Archimedean spiral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral) for my
tattoo.
